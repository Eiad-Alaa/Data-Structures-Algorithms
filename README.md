# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

Welcome to my repository for data structures and algorithms! In this repository, I've implemented various topics from my course using C++. Below, I'll provide a concise overview of each section:

## 1. Sorting Algorithms

I've implemented several sorting algorithms, each thoroughly tested and compared for their time complexities. Here's a brief description of each algorithm:

- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts an array or list.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
- **Quick Sort**: A fast and efficient sorting algorithm based on partitioning.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: A straightforward algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array.
- **Hybrid Sort**: A hybrid approach that combines Merge and Insertion sorting techniques.

## 2. Red-Black Trees ðŸŒ³ðŸ”´âš«

Red-black trees are self-balancing binary search trees. Here are the key operations related to red-black trees:

- **Insertion**: Describe how nodes are inserted while maintaining the red-black properties.
- **Search**: Explain how to search for a specific value in the tree.
- **Node Rotation**: Briefly discuss the concept of rotations (left and right) and their role in maintaining balance.
- ### Dictionary Application:
   The `dictionary.cpp` file serves as the entry point for my red-black tree application. It handles user input, displays results, and interacts with the `dictionary.txt` file.

## 3. Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems related to networks and connections. Here are two important graph algorithms:

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**: Find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm**: Construct a minimum spanning tree from a connected, undirected graph.
